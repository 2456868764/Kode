# Agent Loop Fix Summary

## Root Cause Analysis

The agent loop was breaking because we introduced complex async @mention processing that interrupted the clean message flow. The original working codebase uses a simple, synchronous approach.

## Key Problems Identified

1. **Complex Async Processing**: The modified code added multiple async imports and checks during message processing
2. **Input Modification**: Removing @mentions and injecting system reminders changed the message structure
3. **Flow Interruption**: The async operations and input modifications broke the continuous agent execution loop

## Solution Applied

Restored the original simple message processing:
- Use `resolveFileReferences` to embed file content directly (as the original does)
- Remove complex agent mention detection
- Keep the message flow synchronous and clean

## Original vs Modified

### Original (Working):
```typescript
// Simple and direct
if (input.includes('@')) {
  processedInput = await resolveFileReferences(processedInput)
}
```

### Modified (Broken):
```typescript
// Complex with multiple async operations
if (input.includes('@')) {
  // Multiple async imports
  // Agent detection logic
  // System reminder generation
  // Input modification
  // ... 70+ lines of complex logic
}
```

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Preserves Message Integrity**: Messages flow through without modification
2. **No Async Interruptions**: Simple, predictable execution
3. **Maintains Agent Context**: The agent loop can continue without context loss

## Testing

The agent loop should now work properly:
- Messages will process continuously
- Agents can execute multiple rounds
- @file mentions will embed content (as designed)
- No unexpected interruptions

## Lesson Learned

**Keep the message processing pipeline simple and synchronous.** Complex async operations and input modifications during message processing break the agent execution loop. Any special handling should be done at the tool execution level, not during message preparation.
