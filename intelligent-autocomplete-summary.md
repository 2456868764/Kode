# Intelligent Autocomplete System Enhancements

## Overview
Successfully implemented a terminal-like intelligent file autocomplete system with context-aware suggestions and improved @mention detection for files.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Fixed @filename Detection
**Problem**: Direct @filename didn't work, only @./ and @/ worked
**Solution**: Enhanced file detection in `useAgentMentionTypeahead` to:
- Search for files without requiring path separators
- Check common file extensions automatically
- Support case-insensitive matching
- Add file icons (📁 for directories, 📄 for files)

### 2. Tab Key Conflict Resolution
**Problem**: Tab key for model switching prevented autocomplete from working
**Solution**: Made Tab key context-aware in `PromptInput.tsx`:
```typescript
// Only switch model if no autocomplete is active
if (!hasSlashSuggestions && !hasAgentSuggestions && !hasPathAutocomplete) {
  handleQuickModelSwitch()
}
```

### 3. Intelligent Path Autocomplete
**New Features**:
- **Context Detection**: Automatically detects when file completion is needed
  - After file commands (cat, ls, cd, vim, etc.)
  - When typing path-like strings
  - After keywords like "with", "from", "to", "in"
  
- **Smart Sorting**: Files are ranked by relevance
  - Command-specific scoring (cd prefers directories)
  - Common important files get higher scores
  - Current directory files prioritized
  - Hidden files deprioritized unless explicitly requested
  
- **Visual Feedback**: Icons for different file types
  - 📁 Directories
  - 🟨 JavaScript
  - 🔷 TypeScript
  - 📝 Markdown
  - 🐍 Python
  - And more...

- **Seamless Experience**:
  - Debounced suggestions while typing (300ms delay)
  - Auto-suggestions for <5 matches
  - Tab completion like terminal
  - Case-insensitive matching

## Usage Examples

### 1. Direct File Mention
```
Type: @package
Shows: 📄 package.json
Tab completes to: @package.json
```

### 2. Command Context
```
Type: cat pa
Shows: 📄 package.json (automatically)
Tab completes to: cat package.json
```

### 3. Directory Navigation
```
Type: cd s
Shows: 📁 src/
Tab completes to: cd src/
```

### 4. Pattern Matching
```
Type: edit from README
Shows: 📝 README.md
Tab completes the path
```

## Technical Implementation

### File Context Detection Algorithm
```typescript
// Detects file context based on:
1. Command analysis (file-related commands)
2. Path-like patterns (/, ., ~, extensions)
3. Keyword patterns (with, from, to, in, file:)
```

### Intelligent Scoring System
```typescript
// Scoring factors:
- Command relevance (+100 for cd→directories)
- File importance (+40 for package.json, README.md)
- Location preference (+20 for current directory)
- Visibility (-10 for hidden files)
- Ignore patterns (-50 for node_modules)
```

### Tab Key Priority
```
1. Slash commands (/command)
2. Agent mentions (@agent-xxx)
3. File paths (context-dependent)
4. Model switching (fallback)
```

## Benefits

1. **No Special Prefix Required**: Works like a real terminal
2. **Context-Aware**: Understands when you need files
3. **Smart Suggestions**: Relevant files appear first
4. **Visual Clarity**: Icons show file types at a glance
5. **Non-Intrusive**: Only suggests when helpful
6. **Terminal-Like**: Familiar Tab completion behavior

## Future Enhancements

1. **History-based scoring**: Remember frequently used files
2. **Fuzzy matching**: Support typos and partial matches
3. **Command-specific filters**: More intelligent filtering per command
4. **Multi-select**: Select multiple files at once
5. **Preview**: Show file contents on hover
