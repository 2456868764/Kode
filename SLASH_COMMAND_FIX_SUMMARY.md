# Slash Command vs Path Completion Fix Summary

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Wrong Trigger Context
**Issue**: `./` and `src/` were incorrectly triggering slash command panel instead of path completion.
**Cause**: The logic was checking if the path started at position 0, which was true for `./` (since `.` is not a space).
**Fix**: Changed to only treat a single `/` at the very beginning of input as a slash command. ALL other cases (`./`, `src/`, `../`, `/usr/`, etc.) are now treated as file paths.

### 2. History Navigation Interruption  
**Issue**: When using up/down arrows to navigate command history, if the recalled command contained `/model` or similar, it would trigger the slash command panel and interrupt navigation.
**Cause**: No detection of history navigation vs. normal typing.
**Fix**: Added history navigation detection by checking for large input changes (>5 chars). When detected, suggestions are cleared and auto-trigger is suppressed.

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes in `useUnifiedCompletion.ts`:

1. **Simplified slash command detection** (lines 105-121):
```typescript
if (lastChar === '/') {
  // ONLY treat single / at the very beginning as slash command
  if (input === '/') {
    return { type: 'command', prefix: '', startPos: 0, endPos: 1 }
  }
  // ALL other cases are file paths
  const fullPath = input.slice(pathStart, input.length)
  return { type: 'file', prefix: fullPath, startPos: pathStart, endPos: input.length }
}
```

2. **Added history navigation detection** (lines 1036-1067):
```typescript
const isHistoryNavigation = Math.abs(input.length - lastInput.current.length) > 5 && 
                            input !== lastInput.current

if (isHistoryNavigation) {
  // Clear suggestions and don't trigger new ones
  return
}
```

## Behavior After Fix

✅ `/` (empty input) → Shows slash commands  
✅ `./` → Shows current directory contents  
✅ `src/` → Shows src directory contents  
✅ `../` → Shows parent directory contents  
✅ History navigation → No interruption from auto-complete  
✅ `/model` (from history) → No auto-trigger, smooth navigation
