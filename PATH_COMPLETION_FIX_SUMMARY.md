# Path Completion Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Users reported that `src/` and `./` were not triggering path completion correctly. Only absolute paths starting with `/` were working properly.

## Root Cause
In the `getWordAtCursor` function (line 127), when a path ended with `/`, the code was incorrectly hardcoding the prefix to just `/` instead of using the entire path:

```typescript
// BUGGY CODE (line 127):
return { type: 'file', prefix: '/', startPos: pathStart, endPos: input.length }
```

This caused the system to always show root directory contents instead of the intended directory.

## Solution Implemented
Changed line 127 to properly capture the entire path as the prefix:

```typescript
// FIXED CODE:
const fullPath = input.slice(pathStart, input.length)
return { type: 'file', prefix: fullPath, startPos: pathStart, endPos: input.length }
```

## Test Results
All path types now work correctly:
- ✅ `src/` - Shows contents of src directory
- ✅ `./` - Shows contents of current directory  
- ✅ `../` - Shows contents of parent directory
- ✅ `src` - Shows matching files/directories
- ✅ `/usr/` - Shows contents of /usr directory
- ✅ `~/` - Shows contents of home directory
- ✅ `src/components/` - Shows nested directory contents
- ✅ `.claude/` - Shows hidden directory contents
- ✅ `./src/` - Shows src directory via relative path

## Impact
This fix restores proper path completion behavior for all relative and absolute paths, making the autocomplete system work as expected in a terminal-like environment.
